# Kiwi
Kiwi is a small animal management tool aimed at bird owners to allow them to view their pets, play them, music, and set alarms for pet-related activities such as chores and vet visits. This small project is a part of our Agile Development course for St. Mary's University's Spring 2022 semester, but may be expanded upon for personal use.
